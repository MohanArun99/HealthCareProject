# HealthCareProject

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a scalable data engineering pipeline to ingest, process, and transform Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Insurance Claims data from multiple healthcare providers and insurance companies.

The pipeline integrates clinical and financial datasets into a unified Common Data Model (CDM), facilitating advanced analytics and streamlined financial reporting for healthcare providers and insurers.
